    <applicationDescription>The following is a proposed application to explore direct and indirect mobile phone to large public display interaction in an informational domain for Goal B of the Public Spaces and Personal Interaction (PSPI) project.

Our application aims to be a city directory, listing shops, stores and facilities around downtown Vancouver, which we call venues.</applicationDescription>
