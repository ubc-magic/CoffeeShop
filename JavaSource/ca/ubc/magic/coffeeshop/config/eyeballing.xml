    <applicationDescription>This game helps us study whether uses prefer doing fine granularity interactions on the large display or on the small display by making users nudge an on screen marker to perform a specified task such as finding the mid point of a line, or adjusting some edges of a shape to make it a parallelogram.</applicationDescription>
    <interactionInstructions>You will need to download the phone client here: http://www.somebogusurl.com/
    This phone client is a Flash Lite 3.0 program wrapped in Adobe's Mobile Packager and has only been tested for the Nokia N95 (both versions of the Nokia N95)
    To change the mode the parent application is in, right click on the Flash application and select "Set xx Mode" where xx is the mode you would like to set the parent application to, note that this does not persist so you need to set it everytime, the default mode is LD mode
    You can check the mode after setting it by hovering your mouse over the bottom right hand corner of the application - where there is a little flap
